            At Cruise AI, a healthcare-focused AI startup, I worked on <b>Scribe AI</b>, 
            an intelligent assistant designed to record doctor–patient conversations and 
            automatically generate transcripts, prescriptions, diagnoses, and clinical documentation. 
            My primary contributions involved <b>product testing</b> and <b>prompt engineering</b> to 
            refine large language model behavior, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and regulatory 
            compliance in medical outputs. By iteratively evaluating edge cases and fine-tuning prompts, 
            I helped improve transcription fidelity and reduced error rates in generated clinical notes,

             Spottr is a modern fitness application I developed that combines AI-powered coaching 
              with comprehensive progress tracking. Built using React, TypeScript, and the Anthropic Claude API, 
              the app provides personalized workout routines and nutrition guidance through an intuitive chat interface. 
              As an avid gym-goer (6 days/week), I recognized the need for a unified platform that brings together workout 
              planning, progress visualization, and nutrition tracking. The application features real-time data visualization 
              using Chart.js for tracking lifts, weight changes, and nutritional intake, all wrapped in a clean, responsive 
              UI built with Tailwind CSS. What sets Spottr apart is its intelligent integration of AI coaching with data-driven
              progress monitoring, creating a truly personalized fitness experience.
